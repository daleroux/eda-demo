## Using eda-demo

### Step 1: Installing and Configuring HTTPD on a few RHEL/Fedora Linux VMs

Create an **index.html** file under the **/var/www/html** directory with proper permissions so that a curl command on your linux VM's will return a "200 OK". Here's an example of how you can test this:

`% curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" your_linux_vm`

`200` 

Under the bash_script directory in the git repo, you'll find a **monitor_httpd.sh** script, modify the following variables so that it reflects your environment:

**EDA**   <-- your fully qualified EDA controller name.

**SITES** <-- provide the names of your linux_vm's on which httpd is configured and running.  

You then start the **monitor_httpd.sh** script which will scan your VM's at every minute, and display a spinning wheel. 

Stop httpd from running on one of your linux VM's with command:

`% sudo systemctl stop httpd`

The monitor_httpd.sh script will notice httpd is down on that vm and send a curl command containing a payload to your EDA controller.
